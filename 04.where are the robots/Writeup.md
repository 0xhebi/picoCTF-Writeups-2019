<h3>Challenge #4 Where are the robots? </h3>

<blockquote><i>Can you find the robots? https://2019shell1.picoctf.com/problem/4159/ (link) or http://2019shell1.picoctf.com:4159</i></blockquote>  


<p>When we visit that URL we get the welcome page with question : Where are the robots? (this challenge is same challenge from the last year) <br>So we go to /robots.txt and we see Disallow : <code>/a44f7.html</code> . We follow that path and we get the flag.
